> In this template, we use `@yuki` as a placeholder for package names. As a user, you might want to replace it with your own organization or project name. You can use find-and-replace to change all the instances of `@yuki` to something like `@my-company` or `@project-name`.

## Installation

```bash
npx create-turbo@latest -e https://github.com/tiesen243/create-yuki-turbo
```

## Quick Start

1. Setup the project:

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
```

2. When you want to add a new UI component:

Run the ui-add script to add a new UI component using the interactive shadcn/ui CLI:

```bash
bun ui-add
```

3. When you want to add a new package:

Run the following command to add a new package:

```bash
bun turbo gen init
```

The generator sets up the package.json, tsconfig.json and a index.ts, as well as configures all the necessary configurations for tooling around your package such as formatting, linting and typechecking. When the package is created, you're ready to go build out the package.
